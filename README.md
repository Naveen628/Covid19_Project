COVID-19 Data Analysis Project Overview

This project utilizes data from the COVID-19 pandemic in the years 2020 and 2021, sourced from Our World in Data, to gain insights and provide a comprehensive view of the global situation. The dataset includes information on cases, deaths, and other statistics, and the analysis was conducted using SQL and visualized using Tableau.

**Key Analyses**

**1. Global COVID-19 Numbers**

	• Calculated the total number of new cases and new deaths globally.

	• Computed the percentage of deaths concerning total cases.

**2. Total Deaths Per Continent**

	• I analyzed and visualized the total COVID-19 deaths on different continents.
    
	• Gained insights into how the pandemic impacted various regions.

**3. Infected Population Percentage**

	• Investigated the percentage of the population infected on a monthly basis.
    
	• Calculated the average infected population percentage.

**4. World Heat Map**

	• I created a world map visualization showing the infected population percentage by country.
    
	• Provided an intuitive overview of infection rates across the globe.
